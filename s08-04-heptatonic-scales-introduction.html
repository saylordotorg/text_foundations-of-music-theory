        <h2 class="title editable block">Brief Survey</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p01">Pre-Tonal (pre-Common Practice) music is generally considered to be music prior to 1587 or1600<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_009">1600 is a convenient benchmark. 1587 is sometimes used as a more specific date. This coincides with the establishment of the <em class="emphasis">Florentine Camerata</em>, (or <em class="emphasis">Camerata di Bardi</em> after its patron), a colloquium of Northern Italian Humanists, Poets, Musicians, and aesthetes. In attempting to “rediscover” and recreate ancient Greek dramatic forms, they developed a new style of music, the “Second Practice,” or “New Style.” This was the origin of Opera.</span>. This period is often referred to as the <em class="emphasis">Modal Era</em> (as opposed to the <em class="emphasis">Tonal Era</em> that is the Common Practice period).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p02">The source materials for Tonal practice consist of the Major/Minor <em class="emphasis">duality</em>. Music of this period essentially relied upon Major and Minor scales and their extrapolated constructs as the formative resources for composition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p03">In the Modal Era, the source materials were a collection of scalar constructs called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Modes</a><span class="glossdef">Heptatonic scales used in early music. Also used in post-Tonal music.</span></span>. Originating as tetrachords in early Greek theory, in early Western music they consisted of a collection of interlocking hexachords, each with specific attributes. In time, as compositional resources evolved, supported by accompanying theoretical principles, Modes became a series of heptatonic scales, each with very specific attributes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p04">Although these were the theoretical basis for early music, modes languished during the Tonal Era. Composers in the 20th-Century, looking for alternative resources to Major and Minor scales, “re-discovered” modes. Modal “flavors” are found in abundance throughout examples of music since 1900.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p05">Modes have become an integral resource in the Jazz style as well. Since the mid-to-late 1950’s, modes are considered to be the initial, or primary source scales for Jazz improvisation, especially in the pedagogical practice called chord/scale equivalency.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_010">Most Jazz scholars identify the seminal recordings of Miles Davis in the late 1950’s as heralding the advent of modal use in Jazz. There is evidence that trumpet player Don Cherry may have used modal resources earlier in the decade.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p06">The Ecclesiastical Modes (or “Church” Modes) were seven-tone scales built upon D, E, F, and G. Each was ordered as an octave species from the modal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">final</a><span class="glossdef">The modal equivalent of <em class="emphasis">Tonic</em> or keynote.</span></span> (modal “tonic”). Each also had a re-ordered version wherein the top tetrachord of each was placed below the modal <em class="emphasis">final</em> (Latin: <em class="emphasis">finalis</em>). The original ordering was called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Authentic</a><span class="glossdef">The original ordering of a mode as an octave species from the <em class="emphasis">final</em>.</span></span> form of the mode, the transposed version was called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Plagal</a><span class="glossdef">A re-ordering of the mode wherein the top tetrachord is placed below the <em class="emphasis">final</em>.</span></span> form.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p07">These alternate <em class="emphasis">Plagal</em> orderings were not new modes: each pair, <em class="emphasis">Authentic</em> and <em class="emphasis">Plagal</em>, had the same <em class="emphasis">final</em>. A particular form was so labeled based upon the range of the modal melody as well as upon the perceived modal dominant within each form.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_s01_p01">Originally, modes had specific names. These names reflect regional or place names from the Hellenistic world but were really stylistic indicators. In early church music modes were numbered sequentially. Eventually, the early names were re-used reflecting their early origins. We label modes using these names.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_s01_p02">In and of themselves, the theoretical modes were considered to have certain flaws in regard to their use in practical composition. These perceived flaws were treated by the use of <em class="emphasis">musia ficta</em>: composers routinely altered pitches to achieve the desired result. For example, the “softening” of the fourth scale degree in Lydian, or adding a <em class="emphasis">Leading Tone</em> to Dorian and Mixolydian.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_011">Because of its unique character, Phrygian was resistant to any alteration.</span></p>

The other earlier modes (again by established practice) gradually polarized toward one or the other of these two forms. Due to the perceived flaws of each mode, they eroded under the weight of their own inefficiency and distilled into either the “Major” mode, or the “Minor” mode. The Locrian mode, while recognized as a theoretical mode was not used in practical composition due to its unstable final resolution.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_012">Locrian was not included in the system of modes until 1482 where it was described in the treatise <em class="emphasis">de Musica</em> of the Spanish composer and theoretician Bartolomé Ramos de Pareja.</span></p>
