        <h2 class="title editable block">The Octave</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s01_p01">To do this, we first separate the entire span of pitches into discrete segments labeled <em class="emphasis">octaves</em> (Italian: <em class="emphasis">ottava</em> “eight”). In this context, an octave is a segment of pitches spanning the distance from one pitch to its pitch-class counterpart above or below. Further, it is customary to speak of pitches as residing in some particular “octave.”</p>

Originally, a register designation system evolved that employed upper- and lower-case letter names. Multiple lower case letters (C, CC, CCC) denoted lower octaves while upper-case letter names followed by one or more apostrophes denoted higher octaves. While this system may still be encountered occasionally, it is gradually being abandoned in favor of a more malleable system.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Register Designation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p01">In the 1970’s, the Acoustical Society of America instituted a register designation system based upon the layout of the piano keyboard. This system uses letter names to denote pitch. Each letter name is followed by a number denoting the octave within which that pitch resides. Each octave begins with the note “C” and extends to the “B” seven steps above.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p02">There are three pitches below the lowest C (C1) on the average piano keyboard. These notes are labeled in two ways: A0, Bb0, B0, or simply A, Bb, B. So, the entire piano keyboard spans the range from A0 to C8. <a class="xref" href="#cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_f01">Figure 2.18 "Keyboard with Octave Designations"</a> shows this entire keyboard with each octave designation labeled.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p03">The use of register designations is coupled with, and reinforced by, the visual tool of the piano keyboard. This becomes an indispensable skill for every musician.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p04">Often the range of a particular segment of music will be written in extremes of register, high or low. This is notated using multiple ledger lines. Often, as a notational convenience and to make for ease of reading, composers may employ symbols denoting that a passage is played an octave higher than written (<em class="emphasis">8va-ottava</em>), or an octave lower than written (<em class="emphasis">8vb-ottava bassa</em>). In order to avoid using ledger lines, the passage is written in a lower octave, then labeled above the staff if <em class="emphasis">8va</em>, below the staff if <em class="emphasis">8vb</em>. A bracket extends from the <em class="emphasis">ottava</em> symbol to the end of the passage that is raised or lowered.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p05">At times composers will use the symbols <em class="emphasis">15ma</em> and <em class="emphasis">15mb</em> to denote that the passage is to be played two octaves higher or lower. While uncommon, this is occasionally used, especially as a notational convenience. A composer may indicate that a passage is to be performed two octaves higher or lower by including this as an instruction.</p>
