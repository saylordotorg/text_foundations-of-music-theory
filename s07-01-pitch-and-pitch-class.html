        <h2 class="title editable block">The Staff</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p01">Since early notation was not specific as to exact placement of pitch, a system of parallel horizontal lines came into use in order to show exact placement.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_001">Interestingly, earlier systems of notation employing parallel lines had been in use. Many used <em class="emphasis">only</em> the lines themselves to locate pitch, not the spaces between.</span> This <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">staff</a><span class="glossdef">The Staff (or staves) is a system of parallel lines used to locate and notate specific pitches.</span></span> originated as a system of eleven parallel lines that encompassed the theoretical span of available pitches, which was the range of the male voice from Bass to male Soprano.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_002">In St. Paul’s Epistle to the Corinthians he delivers an injunction to “Let your women keep silence in the Church…” This became the rationale for the exclusion of women from participation in the early church.</span> In practice, this complete system was limited to four or five parallel lines encompassing the range of a given chant melody or voice part.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p02">Pitches were assigned specific names. The lowest pitch, called <em class="emphasis">gamma</em>, extended to the highest pitch, <em class="emphasis">ut</em>: the contraction of these two terms, <em class="emphasis">gamut</em>, has entered the language to mean “a complete range or scope.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p03">The eleven-line system is visually cumbersome. In early music specific lines were colored with different dyes, each line locating a specific pitch. All other pitches were held in relation to these. In time, the eleven-line staff was separated into two five-line staves. The remaining line between the two staves was not drawn, but was understood as being “shared” by each staff.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p04">Specific symbols came into use, replacing the colored lines. Clefs (French-“<em class="emphasis">key</em>”) served the same purpose as colored lines, locating exact pitches around which all other pitches were calculated. These clefs represented general voice ranges and their names reflect this.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p05">We label pitch-classes by the use of letter-names. Other labels are discussed in <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch02_s02#cook_0.0-ch02_s02">Section 2.2 "Chromatic Alteration: Accidentals"</a>. The Treble Clef (or “G-clef”), nominally indicating a high voice, locates the pitch “G” on the second line up on the staff.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p06">The Bass Clef (or “F-clef”) locates the pitch “F” on the fourth line up on the staff. From these two fixed points, all other pitches were calculated and placed on the five-line staff. <a class="xref" href="#cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 2.2 "Treble Clef and Staff; Bass Clef and Staff"</a> shows the Treble and Bass Clefs and pitch placement on lines and spaces.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p02">The student should exercise particular care when drawing ledger lines. A common mistake of nascent music students is placing the ledger line on the wrong side of the notehead. When drawing notes observe several other properties:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Stems extend up or down from the notehead to the next pitch-class of the same name.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_004">This practice for notating stem length has its early origins as a pitch designation, not as a durational value.</span>
</li>
                <li>Stems are drawn down from noteheads on the middle line of the staff and above. Below the middle line, stems are drawn up.</li>
                <li>In extended passages across the middle line of the staff, stems may be the same direction. There is no rule for this: it is a matter of visual uniformity.</li>
                <li>For stems up: the stem is always on the right side of the notehead. For stems down: the stem is always on the left side of the notehead.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_005">Stem placement has not always been uniform. When studying scores of earlier music, one will readily observe that stem placement in relation to the notehead seemed to be a matter of choice, style, or convenience</span>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Pitch Placement on the Staff</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s02_p01">Using these notational devices and practices, exact pitch placement can be shown. Note that the pitch that is one ledger line above Bass Clef is identical to the pitch that is one ledger line below Treble Clef (both are “Middle C”). This shared, connective pitch is reminiscent of the middle line from the Guidonian staff and serves to connect the two staves.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s02_p02">Observe the Grand Staff. Note that pitches of the same letter name occur throughout the system. Individual tones are specifically recognized as such. Pitches having the same letter name but separated by range are recognized as pitch-classes. Therefore the note one ledger line below the Treble Staff is designated as the pitch “C” (or “Middle C”), but all notes so labeled constitute the pitch-class “C.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s02_p03">Also, observe that ledger lines extending notes below Treble Clef may be written in Bass Clef. Similarly, ledger lines extending notes above Bass Clef may be written in Treble Clef. At times, it is more appropriate to write pitches using ledger lines, rather than switching to another staff and clef. Exercise caution when writing or labeling pitches that cross over “between” the staves.</p>

                <li>Pitch is relative highness or lowness of sound. The term is also used to describe specific tones. Pitch-class is a generic designation referring to tones sounding the same but separated by relative highness or lowness.</li>
                <li>The staff is a five-line system used to locate pitches. The Grand Staff is a system of two five-line staves spanning the complete useable range of pitches (with the use of ledger lines).</li>
                <li>Clefs are specialized symbols denoting specific pitches on a staff. All other pitches are located in relation to these.</li>
