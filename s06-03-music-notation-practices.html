In music these groupings are delimited, or “bounded” by vertical strokes called bar lines. Bar lines serve as boundaries, defining a “measure” of music.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn01_003">For these examples we will employ a five-line staff. Use of the staff will be explained fully in <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch02#cook_0.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Elements of Pitch:Sound, Symbol, and Tone"</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch01_s03_p02">The crossover period between Renaissance and Baroque music at end of the 16th Century and the beginning of the 17th Century witnessed many changes as to how music was written. The rise of the “Second Practice,” (<em class="emphasis">Seconda prattica</em>) or “New Style” (<em class="emphasis">Stile moderno</em>) of composition (early opera) and the concomitant rise of instrumental music necessitated changes in notational practice.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch01_s03_p03">Since rhythmic durations in Renaissance music were organized in proportion to one another (differing forms of <em class="emphasis">mensural</em> notation), measures and their separating bar lines were not in use, nor were time signatures, as we know them. These elements came into gradual use. Scholars offer many explanations for this: practicality and ease of reading and interpretation, a shift away from multi-voiced music and toward solo or homophonic settings in dramatic music, the desire for segmenting music into discrete segments, and so forth.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Measure and Bar lines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">This became common notational practice. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">measure</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of music is a span of music, bounded by a bar line. It is a discrete grouping of pulse values dictated by the time signature.</span></span> of music constituted beat groupings (or their durational equivalents) within the context of the stated time signature, bounded by a bar-line. Composers may use a double bar line to denote sectional divisions in a piece. A final bar line ends the composition.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch01_s03_s02_p01">As performers, as teachers, and as potential ensemble leaders, all musicians must have a basic understanding of typical conducting patterns. In conducting, the terms <em class="emphasis">arsis</em> and <em class="emphasis">thesis</em> will be encountered. In this context, synonyms for these terms are “<em class="emphasis">upbeat</em>” (preparatory beat) and “<em class="emphasis">downbeat</em>” (commencement beat). The common conducting patterns are shown in <a class="xref" href="#cook_0.0-ch01_s03_s02_f01">Figure 1.29 "Two-Pattern"</a> through <a class="xref" href="#cook_0.0-ch01_s03_s02_f05">Figure 1.33 "Six-Pattern"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch01_s03_s02_p02">The Basic Two-Pattern: for example any simple duple or compound duple time signature. When practicing this, think “away (from the body)-up, away-up…</p>
