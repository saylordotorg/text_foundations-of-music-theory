        <h2 class="title editable block">Scales</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Scales are comprised of five or more pitches arranged in sequential patterns of whole steps and half steps spanning an <em class="emphasis">octave species</em>. We label scales as to the number of differing elements they contain:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Pentatonic</em>: a five-tone scale.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_001">A true pentatonic scale divides the octave into five-equal steps. This is true in the music of many cultures. Because of the adopted tuning system employed by Western Music (called equal temperament), we must employ elements larger than whole- and half- steps when constructing pentatonic scales. Play only the black keys on the piano and you will readily see and hear this familiar sound.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Hexatonic</em>: a six-tone scale.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Heptatonic</em>: a seven-tone scale.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Octatonic</em>: an eight-tone scale, and so forth.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p02">Four-note sequences are called <em class="emphasis">tetrachords</em> (Greek: “four tones”). In this context, they are regarded as constituent components of larger scale patterns.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p03">Since scales are orderings of whole steps and half steps, these serve as the foundation “building-blocks” for scale construction. As we learn to construct and identify scales, we do so by recognizing their content in terms of <em class="emphasis">tones</em> (whole steps) and <em class="emphasis">semi-tones</em> (half steps).<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_002">Although <em class="emphasis">tone</em> and <em class="emphasis">semi-tone</em> are proper names, whole step and half step are commonly used terms. In some instances you may encounter the terms <em class="emphasis">whole tone</em> and <em class="emphasis">half tone</em> also.</span> For now, avoid calling whole steps and half steps by any other name, for example, “major-seconds” or “minor–seconds.” Proper interval identification for whole steps and half steps shall be addressed in <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch05#cook_0.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Intervals"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p04">Throughout the history of music, various systems of referential tuning have evolved, been adopted, been modified, and been discarded in favor of other systems. It is not within the purview of this discussion to examine these various and sundry systems of tuning.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_003">An exceptionally clear and concise discussion of the history and theory of tuning systems may be found in Chapters 1 and 2 of <em class="emphasis">Chromaticism: Theory and Practice</em>, Howard Boatwright, Walnut Grove Press, 1994.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p05">For our purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the standardized tuning system known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">equal temperament</a><span class="glossdef">The current system of tuning whereby pitches have been adjusted to allow division of the octave into twelve equal portions.</span></span>. Music in the transitional period between the Renaissance and Baroque employed different tuning systems that limited compositional resources. A “compromise” tuning system was proposed and gradually adopted, whereby pitches were slightly altered enabling the division of the octave into twelve equal portions or <em class="emphasis">semi-tones</em> (half steps). This “evenly-tuned,” or “equal-tempered” system allowed composers to employ the full resources of the chromatic collection.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_004">This will come into focus in <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch04#cook_0.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Key Sense, Key Signatures, and The Cycle of Fifths"</a> and <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch05#cook_0.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Intervals"</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p06">Therefore, the source collection for Western music is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Chromatic Scale</a><span class="glossdef">The source set or collection for pitch materials as defined within equal temperament.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_005">The Chromatic Scale, so called because it contains all the pitch “colors,” is also known as the <em class="emphasis">Duodecuple scale</em> (Latin: <em class="emphasis">duo-deca</em>, “two and ten”). It is also labeled the <em class="emphasis">Non-Selective Scale</em>, so-called because, all pitches being of equal quality, no one pitch asserts itself over the others.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s02_p01">The Chromatic Scale is comprised entirely of half steps. When constructing this, it is customary to use sharps when ascending and to use enharmonically equivalent flats when descending.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s02_p02">Music of the mid-17th Century through end of the 19th Century saw the formulation of a more or less unified system of composition and its supportive theory. A <em class="emphasis">lingua franca</em> of music was established, essentially a common language shared by all musicians. Music of the period (roughly!) from Corelli through Brahms is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Common Practice Period</a><span class="glossdef">Music from roughly the 17th- through the 19th Centuries. Also may be referred to as Tonal Music.</span></span>, or the Common Practice style.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s02_p03">One of the fundamental attributes of this Common Practice style was the use of two scale types. These two types, <em class="emphasis">Major</em> and <em class="emphasis">Minor</em> were “distilled” from the multiple scale types employed in early music. Major and Minor scales became the predominant resource for Common Practice music. These scale types shall become essential tools for many of the acquired tasks and skill-sets in the study of music. Understanding and recognizing these constructs is a fundamental and necessary attribute of the music student.</p>

<em class="emphasis">Dominant</em> is five scale-steps up from <em class="emphasis">Tonic</em>. Five steps below <em class="emphasis">Tonic</em> is the fourth scale degree, labeled <em class="emphasis">Subdominant</em>.</li>
            <li>Since the <em class="emphasis">Mediant</em> lies three steps up from <em class="emphasis">Tonic</em>, three steps down is labeled <em class="emphasis">Submediant</em> (the sixth scale degree).</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_p04">Before continuing several very important points must be made:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_l02">
                <li>Minor is considered to be only one entity. It is not appropriate to speak of “three separate minor scales,” as if they are inherently different species.</li>
                <li>Although one entity, minor has three distinct <em class="emphasis">forms</em>, Natural, Harmonic, and Melodic. These forms evolved to accommodate musical and compositional needs over the evolutionary history of Western music.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">The three forms have distinct properties:</p>
                    <ol class="orderedlist" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_l03" numeration="loweralpha">
                        <li>Natural (or Pure) Minor has no <em class="emphasis">Leading Tone</em>. This was considered to be an inherent weakness or flaw.</li>
                        <li>Harmonic Minor seeks to correct this weakness by raising the seventh scale degree, artificially creating a <em class="emphasis">Leading Tone</em>. This in turn generates a <em class="emphasis">melodic</em> flaw in the gap between scale degrees 6 and 7.</li>
                        <li>This melodic flaw was corrected by raising the sixth scale degree (in the presence of the raised seventh scale degree). Since this yields a second tetrachord equivalent to its Major scale counterpart, this process is undone in its descending form by reverting to Natural Minor.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Lastly, Harmonic minor is the expected, normal form of Minor used by composers in practical composition.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_p05">Composers seemed to require the motion from the <em class="emphasis">Leading Tone</em> to the <em class="emphasis">Tonic</em>. Just as much, they seemed to favor the naturally occurring sixth scale degree, the <em class="emphasis">Submediant</em>, “falling” to the <em class="emphasis">Dominant</em>. In the study of music theory, <em class="emphasis">expect</em> to see, <em class="emphasis">expect</em> to hear, and <em class="emphasis">expect</em> to use the Harmonic form of Minor. The unique properties of the other forms are used sparingly and are subject to conditions for their use.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_p06">In summary, major and minor scales form the fundamental source sets, and therefore the basis of the compositional language in Common Practice music. All the great music of the recognized master composers employed these same constructs as the basic elements of their compositional language.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p01">Pre-Tonal (pre-Common Practice) music is generally considered to be music prior to 1587 or1600<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_009">1600 is a convenient benchmark. 1587 is sometimes used as a more specific date. This coincides with the establishment of the <em class="emphasis">Florentine Camerata</em>, (or <em class="emphasis">Camerata di Bardi</em> after its patron), a colloquium of Northern Italian Humanists, Poets, Musicians, and aesthetes. In attempting to “rediscover” and recreate ancient Greek dramatic forms, they developed a new style of music, the “Second Practice,” or “New Style.” This was the origin of Opera.</span>. This period is often referred to as the <em class="emphasis">Modal Era</em> (as opposed to the <em class="emphasis">Tonal Era</em> that is the Common Practice period).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p02">The source materials for Tonal practice consist of the Major/Minor <em class="emphasis">duality</em>. Music of this period essentially relied upon Major and Minor scales and their extrapolated constructs as the formative resources for composition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p03">In the Modal Era, the source materials were a collection of scalar constructs called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Modes</a><span class="glossdef">Heptatonic scales used in early music. Also used in post-Tonal music.</span></span>. Originating as tetrachords in early Greek theory, in early Western music they consisted of a collection of interlocking hexachords, each with specific attributes. In time, as compositional resources evolved, supported by accompanying theoretical principles, Modes became a series of heptatonic scales, each with very specific attributes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p04">Although these were the theoretical basis for early music, modes languished during the Tonal Era. Composers in the 20th-Century, looking for alternative resources to Major and Minor scales, “re-discovered” modes. Modal “flavors” are found in abundance throughout examples of music since 1900.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p05">Modes have become an integral resource in the Jazz style as well. Since the mid-to-late 1950’s, modes are considered to be the initial, or primary source scales for Jazz improvisation, especially in the pedagogical practice called chord/scale equivalency.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_010">Most Jazz scholars identify the seminal recordings of Miles Davis in the late 1950’s as heralding the advent of modal use in Jazz. There is evidence that trumpet player Don Cherry may have used modal resources earlier in the decade.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p06">The Ecclesiastical Modes (or “Church” Modes) were seven-tone scales built upon D, E, F, and G. Each was ordered as an octave species from the modal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">final</a><span class="glossdef">The modal equivalent of <em class="emphasis">Tonic</em> or keynote.</span></span> (modal “tonic”). Each also had a re-ordered version wherein the top tetrachord of each was placed below the modal <em class="emphasis">final</em> (Latin: <em class="emphasis">finalis</em>). The original ordering was called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Authentic</a><span class="glossdef">The original ordering of a mode as an octave species from the <em class="emphasis">final</em>.</span></span> form of the mode, the transposed version was called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Plagal</a><span class="glossdef">A re-ordering of the mode wherein the top tetrachord is placed below the <em class="emphasis">final</em>.</span></span> form.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_p07">These alternate <em class="emphasis">Plagal</em> orderings were not new modes: each pair, <em class="emphasis">Authentic</em> and <em class="emphasis">Plagal</em>, had the same <em class="emphasis">final</em>. A particular form was so labeled based upon the range of the modal melody as well as upon the perceived modal dominant within each form.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s04_s01_s01_p01">Originally, modes had specific names. These names reflect regional or place names from the Hellenistic world but were really stylistic indicators. In early church music modes were numbered sequentially. Eventually, the early names were re-used reflecting their early origins. We label modes using these names.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s06_p01">This chapter provides an overview and discussion of the scalar resources used by composers. The student should focus upon Major and Minor scales at this point. Modes and other scales will become valuable assets in time. There are numerous additional scale patterns that are recognized in various pedagogical practices. The examples given here are those that are the most common.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s06_p02">In the next chapters, Major and Minor scales will become affiliated with specific tonal “regions” or keys. They will also be added to our arsenal of useful tools.</p>
