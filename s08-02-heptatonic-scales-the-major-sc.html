                <li>Both the sixth and seventh scale degrees have been raised. Depending upon the starting pitch and the scale, this uses accidentals in the form of sharp signs, natural signs, or a combination of the two.</li>
                <li>The second tetrachord of this scale is identical to the second tetrachord of the Major scale.</li>
                <li>It is customary to <em class="emphasis">revert</em> to the Natural minor form when descending. This <em class="emphasis">must</em> be shown using the appropriate accidentals. In some melodic minor scales double sharp signs must be used to alter sixth and seventh scale degrees. When reverting back to Natural minor, a Natural sign <em class="emphasis">followed</em> by a sharp sign is used, <em class="emphasis">not merely a sharp alone</em>.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_p04">Before continuing several very important points must be made:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_l02">
                <li>Minor is considered to be only one entity. It is not appropriate to speak of “three separate minor scales,” as if they are inherently different species.</li>
                <li>Although one entity, minor has three distinct <em class="emphasis">forms</em>, Natural, Harmonic, and Melodic. These forms evolved to accommodate musical and compositional needs over the evolutionary history of Western music.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">The three forms have distinct properties:</p>
                    <ol class="orderedlist" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_l03" numeration="loweralpha">
                        <li>Natural (or Pure) Minor has no <em class="emphasis">Leading Tone</em>. This was considered to be an inherent weakness or flaw.</li>
                        <li>Harmonic Minor seeks to correct this weakness by raising the seventh scale degree, artificially creating a <em class="emphasis">Leading Tone</em>. This in turn generates a <em class="emphasis">melodic</em> flaw in the gap between scale degrees 6 and 7.</li>
                        <li>This melodic flaw was corrected by raising the sixth scale degree (in the presence of the raised seventh scale degree). Since this yields a second tetrachord equivalent to its Major scale counterpart, this process is undone in its descending form by reverting to Natural Minor.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Lastly, Harmonic minor is the expected, normal form of Minor used by composers in practical composition.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_p05">Composers seemed to require the motion from the <em class="emphasis">Leading Tone</em> to the <em class="emphasis">Tonic</em>. Just as much, they seemed to favor the naturally occurring sixth scale degree, the <em class="emphasis">Submediant</em>, “falling” to the <em class="emphasis">Dominant</em>. In the study of music theory, <em class="emphasis">expect</em> to see, <em class="emphasis">expect</em> to hear, and <em class="emphasis">expect</em> to use the Harmonic form of Minor. The unique properties of the other forms are used sparingly and are subject to conditions for their use.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s02_s03_s04_p06">In summary, major and minor scales form the fundamental source sets, and therefore the basis of the compositional language in Common Practice music. All the great music of the recognized master composers employed these same constructs as the basic elements of their compositional language.</p>
