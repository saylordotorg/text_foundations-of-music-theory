    <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_p01">In examining the notation of pitch, we observe that notes climbed or “scaled” the lines and spaces of staves from low to high.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Scales</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Scales are comprised of five or more pitches arranged in sequential patterns of whole steps and half steps spanning an <em class="emphasis">octave species</em>. We label scales as to the number of differing elements they contain:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Pentatonic</em>: a five-tone scale.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_001">A true pentatonic scale divides the octave into five-equal steps. This is true in the music of many cultures. Because of the adopted tuning system employed by Western Music (called equal temperament), we must employ elements larger than whole- and half- steps when constructing pentatonic scales. Play only the black keys on the piano and you will readily see and hear this familiar sound.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Hexatonic</em>: a six-tone scale.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Heptatonic</em>: a seven-tone scale.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Octatonic</em>: an eight-tone scale, and so forth.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p02">Four-note sequences are called <em class="emphasis">tetrachords</em> (Greek: “four tones”). In this context, they are regarded as constituent components of larger scale patterns.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p03">Since scales are orderings of whole steps and half steps, these serve as the foundation “building-blocks” for scale construction. As we learn to construct and identify scales, we do so by recognizing their content in terms of <em class="emphasis">tones</em> (whole steps) and <em class="emphasis">semi-tones</em> (half steps).<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_002">Although <em class="emphasis">tone</em> and <em class="emphasis">semi-tone</em> are proper names, whole step and half step are commonly used terms. In some instances you may encounter the terms <em class="emphasis">whole tone</em> and <em class="emphasis">half tone</em> also.</span> For now, avoid calling whole steps and half steps by any other name, for example, “major-seconds” or “minor–seconds.” Proper interval identification for whole steps and half steps shall be addressed in <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch05#cook_0.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Intervals"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p04">Throughout the history of music, various systems of referential tuning have evolved, been adopted, been modified, and been discarded in favor of other systems. It is not within the purview of this discussion to examine these various and sundry systems of tuning.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_003">An exceptionally clear and concise discussion of the history and theory of tuning systems may be found in Chapters 1 and 2 of <em class="emphasis">Chromaticism: Theory and Practice</em>, Howard Boatwright, Walnut Grove Press, 1994.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p05">For our purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the standardized tuning system known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">equal temperament</a><span class="glossdef">The current system of tuning whereby pitches have been adjusted to allow division of the octave into twelve equal portions.</span></span>. Music in the transitional period between the Renaissance and Baroque employed different tuning systems that limited compositional resources. A “compromise” tuning system was proposed and gradually adopted, whereby pitches were slightly altered enabling the division of the octave into twelve equal portions or <em class="emphasis">semi-tones</em> (half steps). This “evenly-tuned,” or “equal-tempered” system allowed composers to employ the full resources of the chromatic collection.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_004">This will come into focus in <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch04#cook_0.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Key Sense, Key Signatures, and The Cycle of Fifths"</a> and <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch05#cook_0.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Intervals"</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s01_p06">Therefore, the source collection for Western music is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Chromatic Scale</a><span class="glossdef">The source set or collection for pitch materials as defined within equal temperament.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn03_005">The Chromatic Scale, so called because it contains all the pitch “colors,” is also known as the <em class="emphasis">Duodecuple scale</em> (Latin: <em class="emphasis">duo-deca</em>, “two and ten”). It is also labeled the <em class="emphasis">Non-Selective Scale</em>, so-called because, all pitches being of equal quality, no one pitch asserts itself over the others.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s02_p01">The Chromatic Scale is comprised entirely of half steps. When constructing this, it is customary to use sharps when ascending and to use enharmonically equivalent flats when descending.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s02_p02">Music of the mid-17th Century through end of the 19th Century saw the formulation of a more or less unified system of composition and its supportive theory. A <em class="emphasis">lingua franca</em> of music was established, essentially a common language shared by all musicians. Music of the period (roughly!) from Corelli through Brahms is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Common Practice Period</a><span class="glossdef">Music from roughly the 17th- through the 19th Centuries. Also may be referred to as Tonal Music.</span></span>, or the Common Practice style.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch03_s01_s02_p03">One of the fundamental attributes of this Common Practice style was the use of two scale types. These two types, <em class="emphasis">Major</em> and <em class="emphasis">Minor</em> were “distilled” from the multiple scale types employed in early music. Major and Minor scales became the predominant resource for Common Practice music. These scale types shall become essential tools for many of the acquired tasks and skill-sets in the study of music. Understanding and recognizing these constructs is a fundamental and necessary attribute of the music student.</p>
