    <div class="section" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s00">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s00_p01">In <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch01#cook_0.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Elements of Rhythm: Sound, Symbol, and Time"</a> we discovered how music is organized temporally and how that temporal organization is symbolized in written notation. Aspects of rhythm and rhythmic notation, meter, and basic formal organization were discussed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s00_p02">In this chapter we shall explore how tone is represented in music. In early music sound or tone was not precisely notated. Rather, a system of mnemonic symbols called <em class="emphasis">neumes</em> gave only an approximate indication of where tones sounded in relationship to one another in terms of relative highness or lowness. Many notation traditions and practices evolved in early Western music: there was no uniform practice as to how sound in music was notated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s00_p03">From this early use as a memory device, notational practice evolved over time toward a standardized system of notation and, more importantly, toward an exact system of tone placement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s00_p04">Musicologists credit Guido d’Arezzo (c. 990–1050) for this all-important development. Among his many pedagogical contributions, Guido adapted and synthesized elements of numerous notational practices in order to formulate a standardized notational system. The significance of his contributions and pedagogical tools forms the basis of how music notation evolved into recognized standard notation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Staff</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p01">Since early notation was not specific as to exact placement of pitch, a system of parallel horizontal lines came into use in order to show exact placement.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_001">Interestingly, earlier systems of notation employing parallel lines had been in use. Many used <em class="emphasis">only</em> the lines themselves to locate pitch, not the spaces between.</span> This <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">staff</a><span class="glossdef">The Staff (or staves) is a system of parallel lines used to locate and notate specific pitches.</span></span> originated as a system of eleven parallel lines that encompassed the theoretical span of available pitches, which was the range of the male voice from Bass to male Soprano.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_002">In St. Paul’s Epistle to the Corinthians he delivers an injunction to “Let your women keep silence in the Church…” This became the rationale for the exclusion of women from participation in the early church.</span> In practice, this complete system was limited to four or five parallel lines encompassing the range of a given chant melody or voice part.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p02">Pitches were assigned specific names. The lowest pitch, called <em class="emphasis">gamma</em>, extended to the highest pitch, <em class="emphasis">ut</em>: the contraction of these two terms, <em class="emphasis">gamut</em>, has entered the language to mean “a complete range or scope.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p03">The eleven-line system is visually cumbersome. In early music specific lines were colored with different dyes, each line locating a specific pitch. All other pitches were held in relation to these. In time, the eleven-line staff was separated into two five-line staves. The remaining line between the two staves was not drawn, but was understood as being “shared” by each staff.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p04">Specific symbols came into use, replacing the colored lines. Clefs (French-“<em class="emphasis">key</em>”) served the same purpose as colored lines, locating exact pitches around which all other pitches were calculated. These clefs represented general voice ranges and their names reflect this.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p05">We label pitch-classes by the use of letter-names. Other labels are discussed in <a class="xref" href="cook_0.0-ch02_s02#cook_0.0-ch02_s02">Section 2.2 "Chromatic Alteration: Accidentals"</a>. The Treble Clef (or “G-clef”), nominally indicating a high voice, locates the pitch “G” on the second line up on the staff.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_p06">The Bass Clef (or “F-clef”) locates the pitch “F” on the fourth line up on the staff. From these two fixed points, all other pitches were calculated and placed on the five-line staff. <a class="xref" href="#cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 2.2 "Treble Clef and Staff; Bass Clef and Staff"</a> shows the Treble and Bass Clefs and pitch placement on lines and spaces.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p02">The student should exercise particular care when drawing ledger lines. A common mistake of nascent music students is placing the ledger line on the wrong side of the notehead. When drawing notes observe several other properties:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Stems extend up or down from the notehead to the next pitch-class of the same name.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_004">This practice for notating stem length has its early origins as a pitch designation, not as a durational value.</span>
</li>
                <li>Stems are drawn down from noteheads on the middle line of the staff and above. Below the middle line, stems are drawn up.</li>
                <li>In extended passages across the middle line of the staff, stems may be the same direction. There is no rule for this: it is a matter of visual uniformity.</li>
                <li>For stems up: the stem is always on the right side of the notehead. For stems down: the stem is always on the left side of the notehead.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_005">Stem placement has not always been uniform. When studying scores of earlier music, one will readily observe that stem placement in relation to the notehead seemed to be a matter of choice, style, or convenience</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s02_p01">Using these notational devices and practices, exact pitch placement can be shown. Note that the pitch that is one ledger line above Bass Clef is identical to the pitch that is one ledger line below Treble Clef (both are “Middle C”). This shared, connective pitch is reminiscent of the middle line from the Guidonian staff and serves to connect the two staves.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s02_p02">Observe the Grand Staff. Note that pitches of the same letter name occur throughout the system. Individual tones are specifically recognized as such. Pitches having the same letter name but separated by range are recognized as pitch-classes. Therefore the note one ledger line below the Treble Staff is designated as the pitch “C” (or “Middle C”), but all notes so labeled constitute the pitch-class “C.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s01_s02_p03">Also, observe that ledger lines extending notes below Treble Clef may be written in Bass Clef. Similarly, ledger lines extending notes above Bass Clef may be written in Treble Clef. At times, it is more appropriate to write pitches using ledger lines, rather than switching to another staff and clef. Exercise caution when writing or labeling pitches that cross over “between” the staves.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s02_p01">The term <em class="emphasis">diatonic</em> denotes pitches that occur naturally in a theoretical system of music with respect to its components. A simplistic (and incorrect) view describes diatonic pitches as “the white notes” on the piano. The word <em class="emphasis">chromatic</em> comes from the Greek word for “color,” <em class="emphasis">kromos</em>. In early music, this term was employed to describe those pitches lying outside of the theoretical collection of pitches, pitches that were altered for various reasons. The term <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chromaticism</a><span class="glossdef">Chromaticism refers to those altered pitches that lie “outside” the range of a particular collection.</span></span> will recur from time to time to describe altered pitches and their effects in music.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s02_p02">Early music made use of a fixed number of pitches organized into a system of overlapping six-tone sequences (<em class="emphasis">hexachords</em>). As compositional styles evolved and new resources added, composers routinely altered pitches for a variety of reasons. Sometimes a pitch was considered to sound too “hard” and was therefore “softened” (lowered). Sometimes pitches were altered (raised) to provide a more pronounced resolution to a following pitch. These altered pitches were called <em class="emphasis">musica ficta</em> (“contrived” or “feigned” music; “false” music). Originally the conditional use of these alterations was understood, therefore not notated. In time, the symbols representing an altered pitch were added above the note, almost as an editorial marking. Eventually these symbols were incorporated into the music, preceding the note they modified.</p>
    <div class="section" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Accidentals</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s02_s01_p01">These symbols became what we call <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">accidentals</a><span class="glossdef">Accidentals are those specialized symbols used to show chromatic alterations.</span></span>. The need for these alterations came about because of our inherently flawed system of notating pitch: we have twelve pitches in our system yet only seven letter names. Accidentals accommodate these alterations. The “sharp” sign (the octothorpe or “pound” sign) raises a pitch, the “flat” sign (lower-case “b”) lowers a pitch. The natural sign cancels any other accidental. Double flats and double sharps may occur occasionally, their use determined by context.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s02_s01_p02">Accidentals are always placed before the note that they modify, never behind. As a notational convenience, an accidental will stay in effect throughout the measure where it occurs. Any repetitions of that modified note within the measure remain modified. The note reverts to its diatonic form in subsequent measures.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_006">In much music of the modern era, accidentals only modify those notes that they immediately precede. If this is the case, it is so indicated in performance notes.</span> Often however, as a reminder, composers will place a precautionary accidental before the note that was previously chromatically altered.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Octave</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s01_p01">To do this, we first separate the entire span of pitches into discrete segments labeled <em class="emphasis">octaves</em> (Italian: <em class="emphasis">ottava</em> “eight”). In this context, an octave is a segment of pitches spanning the distance from one pitch to its pitch-class counterpart above or below. Further, it is customary to speak of pitches as residing in some particular “octave.”</p>

Originally, a register designation system evolved that employed upper- and lower-case letter names. Multiple lower case letters (C, CC, CCC) denoted lower octaves while upper-case letter names followed by one or more apostrophes denoted higher octaves. While this system may still be encountered occasionally, it is gradually being abandoned in favor of a more malleable system.</p>

    <div class="section" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Register Designation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p01">In the 1970’s, the Acoustical Society of America instituted a register designation system based upon the layout of the piano keyboard. This system uses letter names to denote pitch. Each letter name is followed by a number denoting the octave within which that pitch resides. Each octave begins with the note “C” and extends to the “B” seven steps above.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p02">There are three pitches below the lowest C (C1) on the average piano keyboard. These notes are labeled in two ways: A0, Bb0, B0, or simply A, Bb, B. So, the entire piano keyboard spans the range from A0 to C8. <a class="xref" href="#cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_f01">Figure 2.18 "Keyboard with Octave Designations"</a> shows this entire keyboard with each octave designation labeled.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p03">The use of register designations is coupled with, and reinforced by, the visual tool of the piano keyboard. This becomes an indispensable skill for every musician.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p04">Often the range of a particular segment of music will be written in extremes of register, high or low. This is notated using multiple ledger lines. Often, as a notational convenience and to make for ease of reading, composers may employ symbols denoting that a passage is played an octave higher than written (<em class="emphasis">8va-ottava</em>), or an octave lower than written (<em class="emphasis">8vb-ottava bassa</em>). In order to avoid using ledger lines, the passage is written in a lower octave, then labeled above the staff if <em class="emphasis">8va</em>, below the staff if <em class="emphasis">8vb</em>. A bracket extends from the <em class="emphasis">ottava</em> symbol to the end of the passage that is raised or lowered.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s04_s02_p05">At times composers will use the symbols <em class="emphasis">15ma</em> and <em class="emphasis">15mb</em> to denote that the passage is to be played two octaves higher or lower. While uncommon, this is occasionally used, especially as a notational convenience. A composer may indicate that a passage is to be performed two octaves higher or lower by including this as an instruction.</p>

Originally used as a pedagogical mnemonic.</span></span> syllables. This tradition originated as a pedagogical device invented by Guido. The syllables, originally <em class="emphasis">Ut</em>, <em class="emphasis">Re</em>, <em class="emphasis">Mi</em>, <em class="emphasis">Fa</em>, <em class="emphasis">Sol</em>, <em class="emphasis">La</em>, come from the initial syllable of each line of <em class="emphasis">Ut queant laxis</em>, an Ambrosian hymn to St. John the Baptist. Each line of music starts on a successively higher pitch. Guido employed this as a pedagogical tool for training singers.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s05_p02">Since <em class="emphasis">Ut</em> is the only syllable in the collection ending on a hard consonance, it was eventually replaced by the syllable <em class="emphasis">Do</em> (from <em class="emphasis">Domine</em> -Latin-“Lord”) to facilitate singing. In the 15th-century a seventh tone and syllable was added, <em class="emphasis">Si</em>, an acronym for <em class="emphasis">Sancte Ioannes</em>, the last two words from <em class="emphasis">Ut queant laxis</em>,. This became the syllable <em class="emphasis">Ti</em> in 19th-century English sol-fa.<span class="footnote" id="cook_0.0-fn02_007">The inclusion of the syllable <em class="emphasis">Ti</em> is attributed to Sarah Glover. <em class="emphasis">Ti</em> was substituted for <em class="emphasis">Si</em> so that each solfége syllable would begin on a differing consonant.</span> Thus we have <em class="emphasis">solfége</em> labels for pitches.</p>

A modified, moveable system of <em class="emphasis">solfége</em> has become prevalent in American music theory pedagogy.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s06_s01_p02">This clef may occur on any line in the staff. Regardless of which line it occurs on, it always locates C4, “Middle C.” Originally, the use of this clef was concerned with particular voice ranges. The moveable C-Clef kept the majority of pitches of a given voice within the boundaries of the staff conforming to the typical range of that voice. Hence the common names for this clef as it occurs on each line reflect the associated voice part.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s06_s02_p01">The C-Clef on the lowest line of the staff is called Soprano Clef, the second line Mezzo-Soprano Clef, the third line <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Alto Clef</a><span class="glossdef">The C-clef placed on the second line of the staff.

Until the 19th Century (approximately) choral music was written in open score, each voice part on a separate staff with the appropriate clef. Gradually this became an arcane procedure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s06_s02_p02">Two of the Moveable C-Clefs have been retained in common use in instrumental writing, primarily because of the ranges of certain instruments. Alto Clef is predominantly used in writing for the Viola. If Treble or Bass Clefs were used, the Viola part would need to be written with a surfeit of ledger lines-it’s general range occupies the space “between” and “overlapping” Treble and Bass Clefs. The ‘Cello often employs Tenor Clef (in addition to Bass Clef). In orchestral and more advanced wind ensemble literature (but curiously, not in Jazz), Tenor Clef may be used for the upper register of the Trombone. Again, the purpose is to keep the majority of the pitches within the boundaries of the staff.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Other Clefs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s06_s03_p01">The remaining C-Clefs are not normally encountered except in autograph scores and facsimile editions of earlier music. There are several other clefs, one of which has become very common, the others rarely seen. In Choral writing, Tenor Clef is commonly replaced by a Treble Clef with an “8” (<em class="emphasis">ottava</em>) sign appended to the bottom of the clef.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cook_0.0-ch02_s06_s03_p02">As open score became less common, and as fewer musicians were trained to read Tenor Clef efficiently, this “compromise” clef came into general use. It reads exactly as Treble Clef but “sounds” down an octave, conforming to the range of the Tenor voice.</p>
